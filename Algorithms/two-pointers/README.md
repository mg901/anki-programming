# Two Pointers

## Sub-Patterns

### 1. Slow / Fast

- compression
- expansion
- copy-overwrite
- counting + slow pointer
- boundary tracking
- cycle detection (Floyd)
- middle of linked list
- partitioning (like Quick select / Quicksort partition)
  - stable partition
    - duplicate skipping

### 2. Two Ends

- reverse array / string
- palindromes
- minimizing / maximizing distance between two ends
- shrinking / growing the range

### 3. Sliding Window

- sub-array sum
- longest / shortest substring with condition
- fixed-size window
- variable-size window

### 4. Merge Walk

- merge sorted arrays
- merge intervals
- intersections
- comparison of two sequences
- merge k lists
- diff / union of two sorted sequences
- counting overlaps
